**Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)**

**Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)** is a publish/subscribe service. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers. This is similar to the coffee shop; the cashier provides coffee orders to the barista who makes the drinks.

In Amazon SNS, subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, AWS Lambda functions, or several other options. 

In the next lesson, you will learn more about AWS Lambda.
