- I am currently learning from [System-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) from this GitHub Repo.
## Introduction

System design interviews are a critical part of the technical interview process for many software engineering roles. These interviews evaluate your ability to design scalable, high-performing, and fault-tolerant systems. This repository serves as a one-stop resource to help you master these concepts and ace your interviews.

The content provided here will walk you through the foundational principles of system design, offer real-world examples, and provide tips on how to approach design problems.
## Why System Design?

System design interviews assess your ability to:
- Build large-scale, distributed systems.
- Make trade-offs between performance, scalability, consistency, and availability.
- Work with databases, caches, load balancers, and other infrastructure components.
- Architect solutions under ambiguous requirements.
- Demonstrate your knowledge of real-world technologies and practices.

Mastering system design not only helps you in interviews but also makes you a better software engineer by providing you with the skills to tackle complex challenges in real-world applications.

### Obsidian Setup 

- To use Markdown links from the start so you donâ€™t have to convert them later, 
	- disable Settings > Files & Links > Use Wikilinks.
- Once you do that, you can still type the double brackets (you have to if you want autocomplete suggestions), and they will convert to Markdown when completed.
