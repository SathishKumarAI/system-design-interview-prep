Operational data usually needs to be _transformed_ into suitable structure and format for analysis, often as part of an _extract, transform, and load_ (ETL) process; though increasingly a variation in which you _extract, load, and transform_ (ELT) the data is used to quickly ingest the data into a data lake and then apply "big data" processing techniques to transform it. Regardless of the approach used, the data is prepared to support downstream analytical needs.
